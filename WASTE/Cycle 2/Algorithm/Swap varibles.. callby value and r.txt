1) start          SWAP 2 Variables using call by value and call by referrence
2) Get 2 values from user into a and b.
3) Pass these values stored in a and b to a function swap_value
4) Pass the address of a and b to a function swap_reference
5) Stop

1) Start           swap_value function
2) Initialize a temp variable with 0.
3) Get 2 values from function call to a and b.
3) Store value of a to temp , b to a and then temp to a
4) Print out values of a and b to user
5) Stop 

1) Start               swap_referrence function
2) Initialize a temp variabl with 0
3) Get 2 address values from function call and store it to 2 pointers a and b
4) Store value of *a to temp, *b to *a and temp to *a
5) Display value of *a and *b to user
